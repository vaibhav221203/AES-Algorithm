# AES-Algorithm
This project showcases the implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm using VLSI (Very-Large-Scale Integration) language. The AES algorithm is a widely recognized and robust encryption standard used for securing sensitive data. This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the AES algorithm
